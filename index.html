                <p class="highlight">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <p class="details">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structur from professionals who can help me learned 
                    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire 
                    curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project in particular was
                    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutoria could ever have, in fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a Junior Full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended."</p>
